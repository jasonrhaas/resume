## SUMMARY

Python developer, engineer, data guru, entrepreneur. I build software tools that operate at scale. I’m a believer in open source, using the right tool for the job, and automating the boring stuff. 

OPEN SOURCE - I'm a believer in OSS and love being part of the community. You can look at my open source contributions at https://github.com/jasonrhaas

TECHNOLOGY STACK - Python, linux, AWS, git, docker, flask, django, ORMs, APIs, blockchain (Ethereum), kafka, ELK (elasticsearch, logstash, kibana), Spark.

EXPERIENCE - I have a M.S. in electrical and computer engineering and 10 years
experience as an engineer. I'm good at working independently, getting
things done, and leading other engineers.

## EDUCATION
### Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA
M.S. & B.S. Electrical Engineering, September 2006  
Honors:  Presidential Scholarship, Phi Eta Sigma

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Founder - Data North, Mar. 2017 - Present (Remote)

I work mostly on back-end web development, APIs, big data platforms, and blockchain (Ethereum). I'm also very good with AWS, setting up architectures and automated systems (continuous integration/delivery). I do some front-end work as well when required.

Some things I've built recently:

- A server-less and micro-service architecture for a cloud-based IoT security system. Technologies used: Python, Flask, Swagger, AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate.
- A fully automated system for running tests, builds, and deploys, using Gitlab and Kubernetes.
- Django web application integration for an Ethereum smart contract. Used web3, truffle, javascript, python.
- Data extraction for arbitrary financial transactions in bank statement PDFs (ETL)

### Senior Software Engineer - IST Research, Nov. 2014 - Mar. 2017 (Remote)

At IST Research, I have been doing software development and setting up large scale distributed data systems. Most work has been funded by DARPA's MEMEX program. Responsibilities include:

- Drive remote engineering development of data collection and visualization systems. 
- Develop Python software focused on data collection, parsing and aggregation. See github.com/istresearch for open source software.
- Deploy and manage software applications and data infrastructure tools using Ansible. Applications are mostly monitored using supervisord, docker, and custom Flask code.
- Perform extraction, transformation, load (ETL) tasks with unstructured and structured data using Python, Storm, and Spark for processing.
- Set up data visualization dashboards using the Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) stack.
- Work in a distributed engineering environment, interacting with the majority of co-workers through Slack, Google hangouts, and Github.

### System Design Engineer - Boeing, March 2009 - October 2014

- Act as primary technical interface to customers on multiple programs.
- Integrate and test complex network based systems – Linux, Solaris 10, Ubuntu, Windows 7.
- Work with JIRA, Accurev, CVS, Jenkins to manage code baseline and integrate into Linux based systems.
- Create and debug Linux Bash shell scripts in order to fix problems or solve new ones.
- Design and deliver electronic systems as lead systems engineer.
- Perform system network security assessments and secure system for connection to external networks.
- Make high level technical decisions and provide programmatic inputs for schedule and budget.
- Contribute to proposal efforts to develop solutions and concepts of operations for customer needs.
- Work on technical white papers for proposed system solutions.
- Develop system engineering solutions to obsolescence issues and perform trade studies.

### RF Systems Engineer - Lockheed Martin, September 2006 - March 2009

- Over 2 years experience in integration and test on RF based systems and troubleshooting issues.
- Focused on prosecution of wireless communication signals (FSK, PSK, OOK, CDMA, TDMA).
- Worked closely with the system architect to write test plans to help meet technical requirements.
- Chosen by management to lead a team demonstration on system capabilities.
- Integrated RF demodulation software and worked with subcontractors to resolve software issues.
- Used MATLAB to create my own software to aid in integrated efforts.
- Documented software functionality and use in the system solution.
- Demonstrated technical capabilities of the software to the customer.
