## SUMMARY Systems engineer turned software engineer and linux hacker. My focus right now is on big data streams -- especially web and social networks.  
**Experience** - I have a M.S. in electrical engineering and 8 years experience as an engineer.  I'm good at working independently, getting things done, and leading other engineers.

**Technical Skills** -- I'm a Python developer but also do DevOps work and some project management.  I'm especially good at using Python and Linux to get things done quickly. I don't prescribe to one doctrine or technology but believe in using the right tool for the job.

**Technology Stack** - Python, bash, linux, git, ELK (elasticsearch, logstash, kibana), ansible, kafka, scrapy, vagrant, docker, storm, spark, hbase.
